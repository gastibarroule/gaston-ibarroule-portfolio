# Cursor Project Rules

## Goals
- The `docs/` folder is the deploy target for GitHub Pages and must not be deleted.
- The `webapp/` folder contains the Next.js source used for local development and rebuilds.

## Editing Rules
1. Do not remove or rename `docs/` or its `CNAME`.
2. When changing projects or content:
   - Update `webapp/src/data/projects.json` or re-run `npm run extract` in `webapp/`.
   - Verify `http://localhost:3000/projects` and a few project detail pages.
3. Before exporting/building for Pages:
   - From `webapp/`: `npm run build && npx next export` (or configured export script).
   - Sync `webapp/out/` â†’ `docs/` using rsync (do not delete `docs/CNAME`).
4. Backups:
   - Run `npm run backup` at repo root before replacing `docs/`.
5. Do not create `src/app/favicon.ico` in Next.js; keep only `public/favicon.ico`.
6. For dynamic routes in Next 15, await params:
   - `export default async function Page({ params }: { params: Promise<{ slug: string }> }) { const { slug } = await params; }`

## Local Run
- Built site (1:1 live): `npx http-server docs -p 3000 -e html -c-1`
- Source app: `cd webapp && npm install && npm run dev`

## Structure
- Keep `webapp/` as source of truth for future edits.
- Keep `docs/` as generated static output; do not hand-edit except index copies for clean URLs.
